+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for facial emotion recognition. We built Lasso/Ridge, Tree-based models, SVM, Voting classifier, and Bagging models based on 2500 image data. The prediction accuracy on test set improves from 22.8% (Baseline model) to 54.28% (final advanced model).
